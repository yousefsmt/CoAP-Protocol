     * \enum Message::MessageType
     * \brief Represents the CoAP message type (the "Type" field in the CoAP header).
     *
     * This enumeration defines the four possible CoAP message types as specified in RFC 7252.
     * The message type determines the reliability mechanism and how the recipient
     * should handle or respond to the message.
     *
     * - CONFIRMABLE:     A reliable message that requires an acknowledgment (ACK) from the
     * recipient. If no ACK is received, the sender retransmits the message.
     * - NON_CONFIRMABLE: An unreliable message that does not require an acknowledgment.
     *                    Used when occasional message loss is acceptable.
     * - ACKNOWLEDGEMENT: Sent in response to a Confirmable message to acknowledge its receipt.
     *                    May optionally contain a response payload.
     * - RESET:           Sent when a message was received but could not be processed
     *                    (e.g., due to missing context or invalid state).
     *
     * \note The Message Type is distinct from the Code field.
     *       MessageType controls transport reliability, while Code identifies
     *       the request method or response status.

     * \enum Message::ClassType
     * \brief Represents the CoAP message code class (high-order 3 bits of the Code field).
     *
     * This enumeration defines the main categories (classes) of CoAP message codes
     * as specified in RFC 7252. The Code field in a CoAP message is an 8-bit value
     * split into:
     * - A 3-bit class (represented by this enum), and
     * - A 5-bit detail value.
     *
     * The class determines the general purpose of the message:
     * - REQUEST:      Indicates a request method such as GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE.
     * - SUCCESS_RESPONSE: Indicates a successful response (e.g., 2.01 Created, 2.05 Content).
     * - CLIENT_ERROR_RESPONSE: Indicates a client-side error (e.g., 4.00 Bad Request, 4.04 Not
     * Found).
     * - SERVER_ERROR_RESPONSE: Indicates a server-side error (e.g., 5.00 Internal Server Error).
     *
     * Other class values (1, 3, 6, 7) are reserved for future use.
